//Example 3.1 has to be like this : 
#include <limits>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(void)
{
	int num = __INT_MAX__ - 2;
	int cnt = 0;
	cout << "Integer overflow in C++:" << endl;  // the book texts has forgotten the 2nd << 
	cout << "Incrementing from " << num << endl;
	while (cnt < 5)
	{ num = num + 1;
	  cnt = cnt + 1;
	  cout << cnt << "   " << num << endl; }
	cout << "Thank you for worrying about integer limits" << endl;
	return 0;
}

//Another way to implement it is :
#include <climits>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(void)
{
	int num = INT_MAX - 2;
	int cnt = 0;
	cout << "Integer overflow in C++:" << endl;  // the book texts has forgotten the 2nd << 
	cout << "Incrementing from " << num << endl;
	while (cnt < 5)
	{ num = num + 1;
	  cnt = cnt + 1;
	  cout << cnt << "   " << num << endl; }
	cout << "Thank you for worrying about integer limits" << endl;
	return 0;
}
//A usefull command is 
// grep -r INT_MAX /usr/include/* | grep limits


//Example 5.3 should be like this, for my g++ compiler to accept it.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(void)
{
	int  a[3], size[4]; 
	a[0]=11; a[1]=12; a[2]=13;
	size[1]=39;size[2]=40;size[3]=41;size[4]=42;
	for(int i=1;i<=4;i++) cout<<" "<<size[i];
	cout << endl;
	for(i=0;i<3;i++) cout<<" "<<a[i];
	cout<<endl;
	return 0;
}
//And by running 
//g++ -Wall -fpermissive  -o Chap5example5.3  Chap5example5.3.cpp
//the definition of int i inside the for loop is accepted , and an executable is produced.
//However I do not get the results that the book wants to show , I get 
39 40 41 42 
42 12 13
//which means that a[0] has assumed the 11 value , but it has been overwritten 
//by the overflow of element size[4] . If I were to define array size[5] , my x86_64 machine
//would allocate many more bytes for size[] , actually 8*sizeof(int) ,and to see the overflow
//I would have to make a main() like this
	int  i, a[3], size[7]; //size[5] or size[6] ...  up to size[8] is the same
	a[0]=11; a[1]=12; a[2]=13;
	size[1]=39;size[2]=40;size[3]=41;size[4]=42;
	size[5]=59;size[6]=60;size[7]=61;size[8]=62;
	for(i=1;i<=7;i++) cout<<" "<<size[i];
	cout << endl;
	for(i=0;i<3;i++) cout<<" "<<a[i];
	cout<<endl;
	return 0;
//with output 
 39 40 41 42 59 60 61 
 62 12 13
